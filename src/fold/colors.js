 * so long as this red color is not too close to yellow or gray, it counts.
 * "Mountain" and "valley" are red and blue respectively,
 * "unassigned" is purple (being blue + red), and then, following the standard
 * put forth by Origami Simulator, yellow is "join" and green is "cut".
 * This leaves "boundary" and "flat", which both take a grayscale value, and
 * should be detected geometrically (boundary edges), but this method
 * will still differentiate, "boundary" is black and "flat" is gray.
