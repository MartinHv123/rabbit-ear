 * @description Given an array of unsolved facePair keys, attempt to solve

 * recursion (one for each guess 1, 2). For each recursion, all solutions are
 * gathered into a single object, and that round's solved facePairs are added
 * to the "...orders" parameter. When all unsolvedKeys are solved, the result
 * is an array of solutions, each solving represeting the set of solutions from
 * each depth. Combine these solutions using Object.assign({}, ...orders)

 * solutions which relate facePairs (key) like "3 5" to an order,
