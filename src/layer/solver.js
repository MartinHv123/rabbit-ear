 * @description Given an array of unsolved facePair keys, attempt to solve
 * the entire set by guessing both states (1, 2) for one key, propagate any
 * implications, repeat another guess (1, 2) on another key, propagate, repeat...
 * This method is recursive but will only branch a maximum of two times each
 * recursion (one for each guess 1, 2). For each recursion, all solutions are
 * gathered into a single object, and that round's solved facePairs are added
 * to the "...orders" parameter. When all unsolvedKeys are solved, the result
 * is an array of solutions, each solving represeting the set of solutions from
 * each depth. Combine these solutions using Object.assign({}, ...orders)

 *   taco_taco: TacoTacoConstraint[],
 *   taco_tortilla: TacoTortillaConstraint[],
 *   tortilla_tortilla: TortillaTortillaConstraint[],
 *   transitivity: TransitivityConstraint[],
 * }} constraints an object containing all constraints for the solver.
 * @param {{
 *   taco_taco: number[][],
 *   taco_tortilla: number[][],

 *   transitivity: number[][],
 * }} lookup a map which relates each facePair (key) to an array of

 * in which **both** of these faces appear.
 * @param {string[]} unsolvedKeys array of facePair keys to be solved
 * @param {...{[key: string]: number}} orders any number of facePairsOrder
 * solutions which relate facePairs (key) like "3 5" to an order,
 * either 0, 1, or 2.
 * @returns {{
