/**
 * @description Given a FOLD graph, already folded, find the layer arrangement
 * between neighboring faces (using edges_faces), and assign a layer ordering
 * between the pair of faces to be 1 or 2, where:
 * - 1: face A is above face B
 * - 2: face A is below face B
 * faces_winding is necessary because a valley fold will place a neighboring
 * face on top of this face, unless this face is already flipped over,
 * then the neighbor will be below this face.
 * This method is able to work in 3D, in preparation, all coplanar faces are
 * clustered, and the plane's normal is established, and all faces_winding
 * winding orders are based off of this common plane normal.
 * @param {FOLD} graph a FOLD object
 * @param {string[]} facePairs an array of space-separated face-pair strings
 * @param {boolean[]} faces_winding for every face, true if the face's
 * winding is counter-clockwise, false if clockwise.
 * @returns {{[key: string]: number}} an object describing all the
 * solved facePairs (keys) and their layer order 1 or 2 (value),
 * the object only includes those facePairs
 * which are solved, so, no 0-value entries will exist.
