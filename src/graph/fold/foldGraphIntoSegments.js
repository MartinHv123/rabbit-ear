/**
 * @description Given a flat-foldable crease pattern, perform a fold through

 * This method does not modify the input graph, it returns the fold line
 * as a list of segments, mapped to the face inside which they lie.
 * @param {FOLD} graph a FOLD object in crease pattern form
 * @param {VecLine2} line a fold line
 * @param {string} assignment the segment's assignment through the first face
 * @param {number} [epsilon=1e-6] an optional epsilon
 * @returns {{
 *   intersections: (FaceEdgeEvent|FaceVertexEvent)[],

 *   points: [number, number][],

 * - intersections: information about the intersection events
