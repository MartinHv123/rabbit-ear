 * @param {number[][]} array_array an array of array of indices,
 * indices which are meant to reference this array itself, for example:
 * vertices_vertices or faces_faces or anything following that pattern.
 * @param {number[]} [rootIndices=[]] the indices of faces to become
 * root nodes. In the case of a disjoint graph and multiple trees,
 * the indices at the beginning of the list will be prioritized.
 * @returns {TreeNode[][][]} an array of trees, where each tree is
 * an array of array of TreeNode. Each tree is organized into depths,
 * where each array contains an array of tree nodes at that depth.
