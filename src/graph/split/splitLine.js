 * @description Given a 2D line and a graph with vertices in 2D, split

 * the new line, prepared as a list of vertices and edges. The indices
 * of the resulting graph are made into arrays with a large hole
 * at the start making sure there is no overlap with the existing graph's
 * indices. This allows the two graphs to very simply be able to be merged.
 * The edge indices will make use of existing vertices when possible, so,
 * edges_vertices may reference vertex indices from the source graph.
 * @param {FOLD} graph a fold graph in creasePattern or foldedForm
 * @param {VecLine2} line a line/ray/segment in vector origin form
 * @param {Function} [lineDomain=() => true] the function which characterizes
 * "line" parameter into a line, ray, or segment.
 * @param {[number, number][]} [interiorPoints=[]] in the case of a ray or segment,
 * place in here the endpoint(s), and they will be included in the result.
 * @param {number} [epsilon=1e-6] an optional epsilon
 * @returns {{
 *   vertices?: number[],
 *   edges_vertices?: number[][],
 *   edges_collinear?: boolean[],
 *   edges_face?: number[][],
 * }} graph a FOLD graph containing only the line's geometry,
 * as a list of vertices and edges, where all new geometry's indices are
 * indexed to start after the input graph's components end, so there is no
 * confusion as to which graph's indices we are referring.
 * - vertices: for each vertex, this is the result of the
 *   intersection algorithm which calculated this vertex's coordinate.
 *   including a "point" property on all entries, which is the vertex's coords.
 * - edges_vertices: new edges, as pairs of vertices, can include references
 *   to new vertices or vertices from the input graph.
 * - edges_face: note "face" not "faces", which face does this new edge lie in
 * - edges_collinear: list of edges from the input graph containing a boolean,
 *   true if the edge lies collinear to the input line.
