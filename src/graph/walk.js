/**

 * the walk from the starting vertex. An optional hash table of walked edges
 * exists as an input in case you are trying to build more than one face,
 * initialize an empty object and pass it in every time you call this method.
 * If you use a global "walkedEdges" and this method is trying to build a
 * face that was already previously built, the method will return undefined.
 * @param {FOLDExtended} graph a FOLD object with the additional vertices_sectors data
 * @param {number} vertex0 starting vertex
 * @param {number} vertex1 second vertex, this sets the direction of the walk
 * @param {object} [walkedEdges={}] memo object, to prevent walking down
 * duplicate paths, or finding duplicate faces, this dictionary will
 * store and check against vertex pairs "i j".
 * @returns {{ vertices: number[], edges: string[], angles?: number[] } | undefined}
 * the walked face, an object arrays of numbers
 * under "vertices", "edges", and "angles", or if you are using a global
