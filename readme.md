# Rabbit Ear

This is a Javascript library for modeling origami.

# overview

This library assists in encoding, modifying, and rendering origami models. Origami models are encoded in [FOLD](https://github.com/edemaine/FOLD/) format, which is a mesh based data structure. Rabbit Ear contains methods for modifying FOLD graphs, a math library, an SVG and WebGL rendering library, and various methods for making origami-related calculations.

# version

The current version is 0.9.4 alpha, released 2024.05.12 [changelog](https://rabbit-ear.github.io/rabbit-ear/changelog.html)

# download

The Rabbit Ear library is distributed as a single package which contains an ES6 module (for NodeJS, Deno, module scripts), and as UMD/CommonJS single-file bundle (for traditional html scripts)
